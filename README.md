# AATRRS
AATRRS (Autonomous All Terrain Rescue and Reconnaissance System)  is a ground vehicle that deploys and communicates with a swarm of drones for real-time navigation, reconnaissance, and obstacle avoidance. This system is designed for search and rescue missions and terrain exploration in environments where humans can't get to.
